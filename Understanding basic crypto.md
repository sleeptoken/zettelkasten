##### Hexadecimal represent of ascii 

First each letter is converted to an ordinal number according to the ASCII table. Then the decimal numbers are converted to base-16 numbers, otherwise known as hexadecimal. The numbers can be combined together, into one long hex string.
eg . "63727970746f7b596f755f77696......."

One character of a Base64 string encodes 6 binary digits (bits), and so 4 characters of Base64 encode three 8-bit bytes.
