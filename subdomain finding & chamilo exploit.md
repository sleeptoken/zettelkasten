## Recon

- `nmap` tells us we have 2 ports open one is ssh and the other is http 
- the website hosted doesn't have any good stuffs on the face of it
- directory busting results aren't interesting either.
### Subdomain Enumeration

##### using wfuzz 
```
wfuzz -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -u http://permx.htb/ -H 'Host:FUZZ.permx.htb' -t 50 --hc 302
```
##### using fuff
```
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -u http://permx.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.permx.htb" -fw 18
```

we find `lms` and `www` as subdomains 
add these in the `/etc/hosts` file as 

```
10.10.11.23 permx.htb
10.10.11.23 lms.permx.htb
```

`lms.permx.htb` has `chamilo` software login page 
we try to find exploits for that version of the software 
### Exploiting
