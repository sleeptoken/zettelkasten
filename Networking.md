## IP Addressing and Subnetting

-  IP address -- in its simplest form -- is just a series of `1` and `0` bits (binary or base 2 numbering)  
    - **IPv4** is 32 bits -- thirty-two 1s and 0s
    - **IPv6** is 128 bits -- one hundred and twenty eight 1s and 0s
- We can take **base 2** and convert to **base 8, base 10,** and **base 16**
    - Converting the IP address to **decimal (base 10)** makes it easier to store that information in databases
