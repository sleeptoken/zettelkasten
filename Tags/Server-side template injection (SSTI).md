A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. Although the templates were deployed statically, the advent of highly configurable service (SaaS) led several template libraries to be exposed directly on the internet.
