**TLD (Top-Level Domain)**
A TLD is the most righthand part of a domain name. There are two types of TLD
1. gTLD (Generic Top Level) - tell the user the domain name's purpose eg. `.com, .org, .edu, .gov`
2. ccTLD (Country Code Top Level Domain) - for geographical purposes eg. `.ca, .in, .us`

**Second-Level Domain**

When registering a domain name, the second-level domain is limited to 63 characters + the TLD and can only use a-z 0-9 and hyphens (cannot start or end with hyphens or have consecutive hyphens).

**Subdomain**

A subdomain sits on the left-hand side of the Second-Level Domain using a period to separate it. A subdomain name has the same creation restrictions as a Second-Level Domain. The max length of a domain name must be kept to 253 characters or less.
