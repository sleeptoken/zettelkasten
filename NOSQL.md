#### There are two different types of NoSQL injection:

- **Syntax injection** - This occurs when you can break the NoSQL query syntax, enabling you to inject your own payload. The methodology is similar to that used in SQL injection
- **Operator injection** - This occurs when you can use NoSQL query operators to manipulate queries.
