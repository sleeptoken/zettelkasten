### Virtualization

Virtualization is the concept of creating multiple virtual environments from shared physical hardware. 
Virtualization allows multiple operating systems to run on a physical device, where the operating systems do not interact or conflict with each other. These multiple environments are known as **Virtual Machines** (VMs).
### Types of Hypervisors

Hypervisors are divided into two categories, which define their position (abstraction) in relation to the hardware of the physical device.

Type 1 (Bare metal)

These types of Hypervisors have direct access to a system's physical hardware,
