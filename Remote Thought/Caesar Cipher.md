Problem - It is 'encrypted' using a simple rotation called ROT13. ROT13 is a variation of a Caesar Cipher [Modular conversion, encoding and encryption online - cryptii](https://cryptii.com/)
It is also in non-standard ciphertext format.  When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries.  This helps obfuscate any patterns.
This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text.

use caeser cipher (shift 13) for above prob.
