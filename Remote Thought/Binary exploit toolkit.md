#### Checksec tool

##### RELRO
stands for Relocation Read-Only, which makes the global offset table (GOT) read-only after the linker resolves functions to it. The GOT is important for techniques such as the ret-to-libc attack you can refer to this blog post: [https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/hardening-elf-binaries-using-relocation-read-only-relro](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/hardening-elf-binaries-using-relocation-read-only-relro).
##### Stack canaries 
are tokens placed after a stack to detect a stack overflow. stack canaries sit beside the stack in memory (where the program variables are stored), and if there is a stack overflow, then the canary will be corrupted. This allows the program to detect a buffer overflow and shut down. You can read more about stack canaries here: [https://www.sans.org/blog/stack-canaries-gingerly-sidestepping-the-cage/](https://www.sans.org/blog/stack-canaries-gingerly-sidestepping-the-cage/).
##### NX
is short for non-executable. If this is enabled, then memory segments can be either writable or executable, but not both. This stops potential attackers from injecting their own malicious code (called shellcode) into the program, because something in a writable segment cannot be executed. - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_space_protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_space_protection)
##### PIE
stands for Position Independent Executable. This loads the program dependencies into random locations, so attacks that rely on memory layout are more difficult to conduct. Here is a good blog about this: [https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1975793](https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1975793)

#### Cyclic - for pattern generation

If you view the c code, you may notice the` print_flag() `function, which will open the flag with the permissions we need. The issue is that the function does not run in the program, the program simply calls start() then ends.

- This program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, because it uses the `gets()` function, which does not check to see if the user input is actually in bounds (you can read about this [here](https://faq.cprogramming.com/cgi-bin/smartfaq.cgi?answer=1049157810&id=1043284351))
- An important part of the memory we can overwrite is the instruction pointer (`IP`), which is called the `eip` on 32-bit machines, and `rip` on 64-bit machines.
- To control the `IP`, the first thing we need do is to is overflow the stack with a pattern, so we can see where the IP is

- fire up `gdb` using `gdb file_name`
- To run a program in `gdb`, type `r`
- if you want to add an input from a text file, you use the "<" key, `r < alphabet`

If you have used `pattern_create` from the `Metasploit` Framework, this is works in a similar way. We can create a pattern file like this:

`cyclic 100 > pattern`

and then run the pattern file as input in `gdb`. We have a segmentation-fault and the `eip` is filled with '`jaaa`'

Our padding is the space we need to get to the `eip`, so 100 is not the number we need. We need our padding to stop right before '`jaaa`' so that we can fill in the `eip` with our own input. -> we use `cyclic_find` for this

for conversion of ascii to raw hex we can use `p32()` function (and `p64` for 64-bit programs) from `pwn`

to print the location of a function, a function that is written in the program but it isn't called by the main function    -    `print& print_flag` output from this code is used in place of `outie` in the below code 

```
from pwn import *
padding = cyclic(cyclic_find('jaaa'))
eip = outie
payload = padding + eip
print(payload)
```
#### Networking

Note from machine  - 
I'm running a service on port 1337, which has an overflow vulnerability. I've left you a version that will run on port 1336 so that you can develop your exploit. 

Code for this level is found in the references section 

The struct at the beginning of the function, called targets, has two variables: `buff` and `printflag`. The buff is a char array of size `MAX` (`MAX` was defined to `32`), and the `printflag` is a volatile `int`. These variables will be right next to each other in the stack, so if we manage to overflow the `buff` variable, then we can edit the `printflag`. If you see further down in the code, if the `printflag` variable is equal to `0xdeadbeef` (in hex) then it will send the flag

ln 2- a script to connect to the port, receive the data, and send our payload. To connect to a port in Pwntools, use the `remote()` function in the format of: `remote(IP, port).`

ln 3- We can receive data with either the `recvn(bytes)` or `recvline()` functions.
- The `recvn()` receives as many bytes as specified
- the `recvline()` will receive data until there is a newline. 
Our code does not send a newline, so we will have to use `recvn()`. In our `test_networking.c` code, the "Give me `deadbeef`: " is 18 bytes, so we will receive 18 bytes.

ln 4,5 - We have to send enough data to overflow the buff variable, and write to the `printflag`. the buff is a 32 byte array, so we can write some character 32 times to overflow buff, and then write our 0xdeadbeef to `printflag`.

ln 7- To receive our flag, We can just use `connect.recvn()` again. According to the `c` code, the flag will be 34 bytes long.

```
from pwn import *
connect = remote('127.0.0.1', 1336)
print(connect.recvn(18))
payload = "A"*32
payload += p32(0xdeadbeef)
connect.send(payload)
print(connect.recvn(34))
```
#### Shellcraft

 ASLR, which stands for address space layout randomization. This randomizes where in memory the executable is loaded each time it is run. Like PIE, it makes attacks that rely on memory layout more difficult.
