#### Checksec tool

##### RELRO
stands for Relocation Read-Only, which makes the global offset table (GOT) read-only after the linker resolves functions to it. The GOT is important for techniques such as the ret-to-libc attack you can refer to this blog post: [https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/hardening-elf-binaries-using-relocation-read-only-relro](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/hardening-elf-binaries-using-relocation-read-only-relro).
##### Stack canaries 
are tokens placed after a stack to detect a stack overflow. stack canaries sit beside the stack in memory (where the program variables are stored), and if there is a stack overflow, then the canary will be corrupted. This allows the program to detect a buffer overflow and shut down. You can read more about stack canaries here: [https://www.sans.org/blog/stack-canaries-gingerly-sidestepping-the-cage/](https://www.sans.org/blog/stack-canaries-gingerly-sidestepping-the-cage/).
##### NX
is short for non-executable. If this is enabled, then memory segments can be either writable or executable, but not both. This stops potential attackers from injecting their own malicious code (called shellcode) into the program, because something in a writable segment cannot be executed. - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_space_protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_space_protection)
##### PIE
stands for Position Independent Executable. This loads the program dependencies into random locations, so attacks that rely on memory layout are more difficult to conduct. Here is a good blog about this: [https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1975793](https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1975793)

#### Cyclic - for pattern generation

If you view the c code, you may notice the` print_flag() `function, which will open the flag with the permissions we need. The issue is that the function does not run in the program, the program simply calls start() then ends.

- This program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, because it uses the `gets()` function, which does not check to see if the user input is actually in bounds (you can read about this [here](https://faq.cprogramming.com/cgi-bin/smartfaq.cgi?answer=1049157810&id=1043284351))
- An important part of the memory we can overwrite is the instruction pointer (`IP`), which is called the `eip` on 32-bit machines, and `rip` on 64-bit machines.
- To control the `IP`, the first thing we need do is to is overflow the stack with a pattern, so we can see where the IP is

- fire up `gdb` using `gdb file_name`
- To run a program in `gdb`, type `r`
- if you want to add an input from a text file, you use the "<" key, `r < alphabet`

If you have used `pattern_create` from the `Metasploit` Framework, this is works in a similar way. We can create a pattern file like this:

`cyclic 100 > pattern`

and then run the pattern file as input in `gdb`. We have a segmentation-fault and the `eip` is filled with '`jaaa`'

Our padding is the space we need to get to the `eip`, so 100 is not the number we need. We need our padding to stop right before '`jaaa`' so that we can fill in the `eip` with our own input. -> we use `cyclic_find` for this

for conversion of ascii to raw hex we can use `p32()` function (and `p64` for 64-bit programs) from `pwn`

to print the location of a function, a function that is written in the program but it isn't called by the main function    -    `print& print_flag` output from this code is used in place of `outie` in the below code 

```
from pwn import *
padding = cyclic(cyclic_find('jaaa'))
eip = outie
payload = padding + eip
print(payload)
```
