### Pay close attention to the messages displayed in every step

In this room you download an image from a hidden directory (obtained from capturing req. on burp) from the website 

- use exiftool for finding out details about an image 
- strings print the sequences of printable characters in files

Hydra can be used to brute force via password list to login to ftp
`hydra  -l  user_name  -P  password_list  ip_paddress  service_name(eg. ftp) `

`locate` can be used directly to search for all the files containing a keyword 

### Privilege Escalation

sudo -l 
`sudo -V ` to find the version of sudo
