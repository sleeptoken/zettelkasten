### Pay close attention to the messages displayed in every step

The default landing page is usually entirely self-contained in that it has an inline stylesheet, rather than linking to an external stylesheet

In this room you download an image from a hidden directory (obtained from capturing req. on burp) from the website 

- use exiftool for finding out details about an image 
- strings print the sequences of printable characters in files

Hydra can be used to brute force via password list to login to ftp
`hydra  -l  user_name  -P  password_list  ip_paddress  service_name(eg. ftp) `

`locate` can be used directly to search for all the files containing a keyword 

### Privilege Escalation

`sudo -l`      list the privileges for the invoking user on the current host 
`sudo -V `    to find the version of sudo 

 instead of having `(ALL, ALL)` inside the brackets of who we can run commands as, we have `(ALL, !root)` meaning that we can’t use sudo as root, but we can use it as anyone else

a vulnerability (CVE-2019-14287) in bash itself that allows us to get around this specific sudo configuration and execute the command as root regardless. [White Source Software](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/new-vulnerability-in-sudo-cve-2019-14287) has a really good explanation of this vulnerability,
 if you select a user with an id of -1, sudo can’t cope with it and just reverts back to 0 (i.e. the id of the root user). What this means is that, whilst we can’t execute commands as the user with id 0 (root), we _can_ execute commands as any other user, including -1, which reverts back to root, thus bypassing the restriction
