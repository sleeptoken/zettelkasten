It is 'encrypted' using a simple rotation called ROT13.  
It is also in non-standard ciphertext format.  When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries.  This helps obfuscate any patterns.
This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text.
