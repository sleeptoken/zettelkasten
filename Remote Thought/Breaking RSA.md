 Let n be a +ve odd integer. Using Fermat's factorization method we can efficiently factorize n into p and q (n = p * q) provided theÂ **difference between p and q is small**.

```
ssh-keygen -lf id_rsa.pub 
```
Show fingerprint of specified public key file along with the length 

```
ssh-keygen -e -m PKCS8 -f id_rsa.pub | openssl rsa -pubin -noout -modulus
```


```
echo "ibase=16; resulting_modules_from_prev_out | BC_LINE_LENGTH=0 bc
```


use the above 2 commands to get the modulus of the public key 
then use a py script(from git or chat gpt) to find the p,q from the above obtained modulus
further use a py script to
