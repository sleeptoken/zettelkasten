- **Stored XSS**: This attack relies on the user input stored in the website’s database. For example, if users can write product reviews that are saved in a database (**_stored_**) and being displayed to other users, the attacker would try to insert a malicious script in their review so that it gets executed in the browsers of other users.

A lot of the methods of - **Validate and sanitize input**, **Use output escaping**, **Apply context-specific encoding** used in stored XSS are similar to the ones used in [[Reflected XSS]]
