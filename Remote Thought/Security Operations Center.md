Soc also known as computer emergency response teams and computer security incident response teams

#### Obj and strategies of soc 

###### Planning 
physical safety must be taken into consideration. 
The soc can contain many areas such as the OP room, a war room, and the office of the supervisor 
###### Analysis 
Improvement of detection of security incidents through continuous monitoring and analysis of data effectiveness
###### Efficiency 
Successful soc leverage threat intelligence and security automatic and orchestration technology 
#### Challenges

##### Too many tools / alerts 

To block every possible attack vector, many organisations have countless tools, following are the limitations of the current tools
**Prioritisation** - don't allow teams to easily prioritize alters for review 
**Full context** - don't provide all the context req for investigation 
**Sophisticated filtering** - seperate policies to filter lowpriority alerts

Org forwards high lev alerts -> soc analyst pivots to analysis tools -> soc analyst reviews logs and investigates malicious activity 

**Adverse event**
Adverse event is any event that has negative consequence. Malware infection on a system

**Security incident**
A violation or imminent threat of violation of organisational cybersecurity policies, intrusion on a network system, DoS, keylogger 

**Incident Response lifecycle**
Prepration -> detection and analysis -> containment, eradication, and recovery -> post incident activity 
#### Frameworks

Based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices for organizations to better manage and reduce their organizational cybersecurity risk. It also encourages comms between internal and external organisation stakeholders regarding cybersecurity 
##### NIST 
Improved security posture 
Core - provides a set of desired activities to be used in a cybersecurity implementation program to meet w the needs of any size org.
Implementation tree - helps org to provide an organisational view for cybersecurity risk mgmt and to discuss their risk appetite , budget and priorities 
Profiles - provides organization a way to strengthen their existing processes or implement new processes. The profiles allow a powerful comms within the organisation 

Plan - each incident response plan has a mission statement, strategies and goals an organisational approach to incident response 

Review - review each incident with post incident activity so that the organisation is prepared for future attacks
