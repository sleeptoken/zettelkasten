`searchsploit -x path` - use this to see details about the exploit and then configure that exploit according to the current machine

if you don't know the version of a service running, then simply search the exploit on exploitDB and guess the version 

sometimes to find the login page you might have to 
do recursive gobusting 
look at the documentation of the web app


```
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
```
use the above to get a stable shell when on a machine where you dont know if it has py or not

when ever you get a revshell dont cd into dir's instead use ls to check out content and then cat out the desired content
