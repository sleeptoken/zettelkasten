`searchsploit -x path` - use this to see details about the exploit and then configure that exploit according to the current machine

if you don't know the version of a service running, then simply search the exploit on exploitDB and guess the version 

sometimes to find the login page you might have to 
- do recursive gobusting 
- look at the documentation of the web app

use `rlwrap` with your `nc` commands - ability to use arrow keys and access command history 

```
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
```
use the above to get a stable shell when on a machine where you dont know if it has py or not

when ever you get a revshell don't `cd` into dir's instead use `ls` to check out content and then cat out the desired content

if you are `www-data` on a linux machine then you should check sudo for privesc

checkout Tib3rius udemy course on Linux privesc for the rootbash method
