`searchsploit -x path` - use this to see details about the exploit and then configure that exploit according to the current machine

if you don't know the version of a service running, then simply search the exploit on exploitDB and guess the version 

sometimes to find the login page you might have to 
- do recursive gobusting 
- look at the documentation of the web app

use `rlwrap` with your `nc` commands - ability to use arrow keys and access command history 

```
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
```
use the above to get a stable shell when on a machine where you dont know if it has py or not

when ever you get a revshell don't `cd` into dir's instead use `ls` to check out content and then cat out the desired content

if you are `www-data` on a linux machine then you should check sudo for privesc

checkout Tib3rius udemy course on Linux privesc for the rootbash method in this method 
- Create an SUID version of bash that we just chuck in the temp folder that way it's gone when the system reboots (easy cleanup) and we can just run it with the dash P option to become root

```
echo "cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash, chmod +s /tmp/bash" > /etc/copy.sh
```
here the whole thing is being copied to `/etc/copy `because in the current box that file is running as root
after running this command check out `sudo -l `to see the perms for current user, further take the`sudo -l` output and sudo that path 
eg. `sudo /usr/bin/perl /home/itguy/backup.pl`
check `tmp` dir, it should have the rootbash binary. run that rootbash binary with `-p` and become root
