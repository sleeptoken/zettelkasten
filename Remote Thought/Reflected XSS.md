- **Reflected XSS**: This attack relies on the user-controlled input reflected to the user. For instance, if you search for a particular term and the resulting page displays the term you searched for (**_reflected_**), the attacker would try to embed a malicious script within the search term. This attack happens often via a **crafted URL** or **form submission**
