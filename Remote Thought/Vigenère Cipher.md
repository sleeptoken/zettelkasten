#### Level 4 - 5

Vigen√®re cipher is a polyalphabetic cipher
we know the key length, we can map every nth letter from the cipher text corresponding to the key length i.e.
```
P P R O C E E D M E E T I N G A S A G R E E D\
K G O L D G O L D G O L D G O L D G O L D G O\
```

Here the key is "GOLD", and all the letters corresponding to G are collected thus making this a monoalphabetic cipher further freq analysis is carried out
