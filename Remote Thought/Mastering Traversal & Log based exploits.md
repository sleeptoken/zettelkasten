### Natas25

- we have a page with some quote written on it and a language dropdown with `de` and `en` as 2 options 
- a function is called that sets the language - in that function a `safeinclude` named function is called that takes a filename as input and checks for directory traversal
- The `safeinclude` function replaces instances of `../` with empty strings and generates a log file in a specified path which is vulnerable 
the safeinclude fucniton also checks if "natas_webpass"
