nmap tells ssh and http port is open
we try subdomain enum using ffuf 

```
ffuf -u "http://board.htb" -H "Host:FUZZ.board.htb" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -fs 15949
```

we find a subdomain named `crm` after adding it to `/etc/hosts` file open the subdomain link in new tab  
a login page is hosted which uses `dolibarr`, we can get an authenticated session by using default creds as admin : admin 

we use the publicly available exploit to get a rev shell on the machine.
on careful inspection of the config files we find a users pass that we use to ssh into the machine
