 - a **Windows domain** is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given business. 
 - The main idea behind a domain is to centralize the administration of common components of a Windows computer network in a single repository called **Active Directory (AD)**. 
 - The server that runs the Active Directory services is known as a **Domain Controller (DC)**.

Active Directory is also the component that allows your school/university to restrict you from accessing the control panel on your school/university machines. Policies will usually be deployed throughout the network so that you don't have administrative privileges over those computers.
