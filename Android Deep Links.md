Web links that result into opening an app are so calledÂ [deep links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking).
## Browser-to-App Attack Surface

They basically connect the world of websites with the world of mobile apps by allowing websites to launch apps.
You can easily recognize whether an app can handle deep links from the Android manifest. By looking for intent filters with the Browsable category
```xml
<intent-filter>
	<category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"/>
</intent-filter>
```
they are allowed to be browsed from a web browser, and usually they also specify one or more data tags
if we click a link that opens our app. our link click is sent as an intent to our app. we can see more information in the debug dialog 

Generally, deep links are interesting because they increase the attack surface of activities from just app to app communication to the whole web.
- If a user clicks on an evil link and that could trigger this activity, the information the website can pass along in the intent to the target app is much more limited than in an app to app communication using `startActivity`.
- But if there is an issue, it's automatically a lot more critical because you can reach it from a website.

Exposing activities through a deep link could happen accidentally. Also some developers intended the exported activities just to be called by a link which is very limited, but these exposed activities can still be called by other apps as well.
## Hijacking Deep Link Intents
 
For example an app has many more deep links registered. So what happens if we just register the same scheme in our app?

- Let's create a deep link activity (right click on the directory (RHS) and select new > activity >empty views activity) 
- We can also use our intent utils (`Utils.showdialog(this,intent)`) to display the incoming deep link intent.
- And then in the Android manifest, we export this activity and paste the intent filters from the app 
  
Now you can click on that link on the website and App Chooser dialog will open and ask you whether you want to open this deep link with the Original app or our malicious app. 

Of course, just being able to register such an intent filter is not itself a vulnerability. That's just how the system works. But apps can use them. Insecurely. For example, if they use these deep links to pass secret information from the website to the app like an authentication token or so .

In the Intent Attack Surface app, we are simulating exactly such a case. The idea is that you want to link your account logged into the browser to the app. (much like how figma logs-in) . To do so, the app opens the website and asks the user to confirm this connection, and the site then uses a deep link to send the intent back to the app. Ideally, you hijack the intent with your own app .
