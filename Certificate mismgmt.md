### Certificate

- **Public key**: At its core, a certificate contains a public key, part of a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is made available to anyone and is used to encrypt data.
- **Private key**: The private key remains secret and is used by the website or server to decrypt the data.
- **Metadata**: Along with the key, it includes metadata that provides additional information about the certificate holder (the website) and the certificate.
