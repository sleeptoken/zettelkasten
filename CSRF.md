### Working 

It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the `same origin policy`, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other. 

key conditions must be in place: 
1. A relevant action. There is an action within the application that the attacker has a reason to induce.
2. Cookie-based session handling. Performing the action involves issuing one or more HTTP requests, and the application relies solely on session cookies to identify the user who has made the requests. There is no other mechanism in place for tracking sessions or validating user requests.
3. No unpredictable request parameters. The requests that perform the action do not contain any parameters whose values the attacker cannot determine or guess. For example, when causing a user to change their password, the function is not vulnerable if an attacker needs to know the value of the existing password. 

 Although `CSRF` is normally described in relation to cookie-based session handling, it also arises in other contexts where the application automatically adds some user credentials to requests, such as HTTP Basic authentication and certificate-based authentication. 
### Construction

`CSRF POC` - it gives us an html that an attacker could host to trick his victim into clicking his malicious form. 

```
<script>
        document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```
the above code will quickly submit the form (if there is a form defined in the html) the moment it appears on the screen 
### Delivery of exploit 

The delivery mechanisms for cross-site request forgery attacks are essentially the same as for [[Reflected XSS]]

Note that some simple CSRF exploits employ the `GET` method and can be fully self-contained with a single URL on the vulnerable website.
### Defenses

- **CSRF tokens** - A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client. When attempting to perform a sensitive action, the client must include the correct CSRF token in the request. 
- **SameSite cookies** - SameSite is a browser security mechanism that determines when a website's cookies are included in requests originating from other websites.
- **Referrer-based validation** - Some applications make use of the HTTP Referrer header to attempt to defend against CSRF attacks, normally by verifying that the request originated from the application's own domain.
### CSRF Token

A common way to share `CSRF tokens` with the client is to include them as a hidden parameter in an HTML form
`CSRF` `tokens` don't have to be sent as hidden parameters in a `POST` request. Some applications place `CSRF` `tokens` in `HTTP` headers, for example.
