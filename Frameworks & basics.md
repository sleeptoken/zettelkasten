If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you will also suffer a defeat - Sun Tzu

### Classification of Attacks

- **passive** - footprinting, sniffing, network traffic analysis
- **active** - DoS, virus, profiling, injection, session hijacking, backdoor access, privesc, MITM
- **close-in** - social engineering (shoulder surfing, dumpster diving, eavesdropping) 
- **insider** - wiretapping, theft of physical devices, pod slurping, planting backdoors
- **distribution** - modification of software of hardware during production 

### Ai tools

Phase 5 : Clearing Tracks

### CyberKill Chain Methodology

is a component of intelligence driven defense for the identification and prevention of malicious intrusion activities

Organizations should understand Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to protect their network against threat actors and upcoming attacks
#### Adversary Behavioral Identification 
involves the identification of the common methods or techniques followed by an adversary to launch attacks to penetrate an organization's network

Given below are some of the behaviors of an adversary that can be used to enhance the detection capabilities of security devices

**Internal Reconnaissance**
	This includes the enumeration of systems, hosts, processes, the execution of various commands to find out information such as the local user context and system configuration, hostname, IP addresses, active remote systems, and programs running on the target systems. 

**Use of PowerShell** 
	To identify the misuse of PowerShell in the network, security professionals can check PowerShell's transcript logs or Windows Event logs. 

**Unspecified Proxy Activities** 
	An adversary can create and configure multiple domains pointing to the same host, thus, allowing an adversary to switch quickly between the domains to avoid detection. Security professionals can find unspecified domains by checking the data feeds that are generated by those domains.

**Use of Command-Line Interface** 
	Security professionals can identify this behavior of an adversary by checking the logs for process ID, processes having arbitrary letters and numbers, and malicious files downloaded from the Internet.

**HTTP User Agent** 
	In HTTP-based communication, the server identifies the connected HTTP client using the user agent field. An adversary modifies the content of the HTTP user agent field to communicate with the compromised system and to carry further attacks. Therefore, security professionals can identify this attack at an initial stage by checking the content of the user agent field. 
	
**Command and Control Server** 
	 Security professionals can detect compromised hosts or networks by identifying the presence of a command and control server by tracking network traffic for outbound connection attempts, unwanted open ports, and other anomalies. 
	
**Use of DNS Tunneling** 
	Adversaries use DNS tunneling to obfuscate malicious traffic in the legitimate traffic carried by common protocols used in the network. Using DNS tunneling, an adversary can also communicate with the command and control server, bypass security controls, and perform data exfiltration. Security professionals can identify DNS tunneling by analyzing malicious DNS requests, DNS payload, unspecified domains, and the destination of DNS requests. 
	
**Use of Web Shell** 
	 it allows an adversary to gain remote access to the functionalities of a server. Using a web shell, an adversary performs various tasks such as data exfiltration, file transfers, and file uploads. Security professionals can identify the web shell running in the network by analyzing server access, suspicious strings that indicate encoding, user agent strings, and through other methods.

**Data Staging** 
	Security professionals can detect data staging by monitoring network traffic for malicious file transfers, file integrity monitoring, and event logs.
#### Indicators of Compromise 

IoC are the clues, artifacts, and pieces of forensic data that are found on a network or OS.
However IoCs are not intelligence; rather, IoCs act as a good source of information about threats that serve as data points in the intelligence process 

IoCs are divided into 4 categories:
- Email Indicators
- Network Indicators
- Host-Based Indicators
- Behavioral Indicators
### MITRE ATT&CK Framework

- MITRE ATT&CK is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations 
- The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, government, and the cybersecurity product and service community 
- The 14 tactic categories within ATT&CK for Enterprise are derived from the later stages (exploit, control, maintain, and execute) of the seven stages of the Cyber Kill Chain
### Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

Extended Diamond model also includes necessary features such as socio-political meta-features to determine the relationship between the adversary and the victim
