What logs/stats in linux  (Numeric preferably) are their which can help in predicting stuff?
Like I want to prolly use the logs generated by my machine to predict stuff, like prolly the only thing I can think of is battery usage.
Basically I want to use do data analysis on the data generated by my linux and make some use of it

- you can use `sensors` to read various sensor data at any time
- CPU cores (online, offline), frequency, temperature (each core, common dice), fan speed (all fans), GPU freq, GPU temp
- you can use `smartctl` to read SMART data about storage devices
- for data around processes, you can read `/proc` filesystem.
- all the processes, which process is taking how much CPU/RAM
	- total CPU stress
	- memory load
- You can use `iotop` and/or `iostat` to track which process is doing how much disk I/O

But you need to refine the problem statement.
Otherwise, you will process some data, and predict something
And that will be “garbage in, garbage out” situation.
