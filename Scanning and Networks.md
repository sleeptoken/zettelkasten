## Scanning

purpose if to discover exploitable communication channels, probe as many listeners as possible, and track the ones that are responsive.

Types of Scanning :

Port scanning - involves connecting to or probing TCP and UDP ports of the target system
Network Scanning - Lists active hosts and IP address
Vulnerability Scanning - Shows the presence of a weakness
### TCP communication Flags

6 TCP control flags manage the connection between hosts and give instructions to the system.
- 4 of these (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST) govern the establishment, maintanace, and termination of a connection,
- the other 2 flags (PSH, URG) provide instructions to the system 
The size of each flag is 1 bit
when the flag value is 1 it is turned on 
### TCP/IP connection

TCP is connection oriented, i.e. it prioritizes connection establishment before data transfer between applications 
### Host Discovery Techniques

#### ARP Ping scan

The ARP packets are sent for discovering all active devices in IPv4 range even though the presence of such devices is hidden by restrictive firewalls. 

In most networks, many IP networks are unused, specifically in the private address ranges of the LAN. Hence, when the attackers try to send IP packets such as ICMP echo request to the target host, the OS must determine the hardware destination address (ARP) corresponding to the target IP for addressing the ethernet frame correctly. For this purpose, a series of ARP requests are issued. ARP scan is used to show the MAC address of the network interface on the device, and it can also show the MAC addresses of all devices sharing the same IPv4 address on the LAN. If the host IP with the respective hardware destination address is active, then the ARP response will be generated by the host; otherwise, after a certain number of ping attempts, the original OS gives up on the host. In other words, when attackers send ARP request probes to the target host, if they receive any ARP response, then the host is active. In case the destination host is found to be unresponsive, the source host adds an incomplete entry to the destination IP in its kernel ARP table.
