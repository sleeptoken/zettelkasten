ADB consists of 3 parts
- **Client**
	- Both client and the server run on the computer 
	- we mostly interact with the client
- **Server** 
	- we don't really interact or manage the server manually 
- **Daemon**
	- runs on the devices and its called ADBD
	- The ADB server running on the computer communicates with the daemon using USB or TCP/IP

`adb shell` - gives a real linux shell into android
`adb -d shell `- always gives the shell of the USB connected device 
`adb -s emulator-5554 shell` - gives the shell of the emulator device running on port `5554` 

### Transferring Files

#### Push
```
adb push <local_file_on_computer> <target_path_on_device>
```
To transfer files between our computer and the device
#### Pull 
```
adb pull <file_path_on_device> [<optional_target path_on_the_computer>]
```
This will store Downloads in your current directory.
#### Android Studio Device Explorer

Android Studio has an integrated Device Explorer, which allows us to explore the device storage with a nice UI.
